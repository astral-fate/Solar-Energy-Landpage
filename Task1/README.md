1️⃣ Pictures of the first task.
2️⃣ The second task: any pictures of yours that you can use.
3️⃣ Deliver to me in private, upload the work to github and send me the links.
4️⃣ As for the fourth task from the end, I gave you an unorganized code, all in one file, and the world is not in order, and he cheated you and told you exactly what to do, meaning everything is clear. You are required to read each point comfortably and see what is required and implement it, nothing more or less. Do not add anything of your own at all. It is very important, guys, this is the fourth task. There is a lot of task in work, pay attention to it, read every point carefully, and know what is required of you.
